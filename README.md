# Neural-POS-Tagging
Part of speech tagging with LSTM.

The project is a part of a homework for the Computational Linguistics course at Language Science & Technology program Saarland University.

## Project Structure
The main program is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook (*neural_pos_tagging.ipynb*).

*\*.conllu files* - train, development and test datasets from [German Universal Dependencies](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_German-GSD) containing German sentences with tagged parts of speech.

*d.py* - Python script loading the data from \*.conllu files (provided by instructors of the course)

*loss_train_dev.png* - a plot of the training progress.
